I created a simple todo app, because I've already completed hello world :) to learn the basics of the Sinatra framework.
I'm also a fan of DaisyUI (tailwind meets boostrap), so I used it for the styling. This also gave me a chance to use ngrok.

Still have to do some style editing and clean it up.

In the terminal, run the following commands:

**1. Run `bundle install`**

**2. `rake db:migrate`**

**3. `bundle exec puma`**

In the browser

**4. Navigate to localhost:9393**

**5. Sign up for an account**

**6. Log in**

**7. Create a new List**

**8. Create a new Task**

**9. Have fun.**
